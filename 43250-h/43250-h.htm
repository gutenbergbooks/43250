<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lives of Our Little English Cousins
are not so widely different from our own in
America. It is only the more ancient associations
with which they are surrounded that
changes their manners and customs.</p>

<p>Their speech is the same and their amusements
and tasks are to a great extent quite
similar.</p>

<p>Certain details of home life vary considerably,
and when they "take their walks abroad," "Our
Little English Cousins," as often as not, visit
some ancient historic shrine from whose associations
have been built up the great British
nation.</p>

<p>Little English cousins and Little American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
cousins alike, however, would have the same
affections for the same things were they but to
change places, therefore things are not so very
different after all.</p>

<p>What Washington is to America, London
is to Britain; meaning in this case England,
Ireland, and Scotland as well, for our little
Scotch and Irish cousins by no means like
one to talk or write of England alone when one
really means Britain.</p>

<p>"Our Little English Cousin" lives in a
less rigorous climate than that which prevails
for the most part in America. Their winters
are in general not so cold (though they are
quite as long) and not usually so bright and
sunny. The summers are by no means so hot
as ours and are accordingly most delightful.</p>

<p>The open-air pleasures of our English cousins,
while existent in our own country, are at
least more general than with us, and tea out-of-doors,
in the garden, or on the banks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
Thames is an institution which is quite unique,
and accordingly, as a summer divertisement,
is greatly in vogue.</p>

<p>The Associations which link America with
England are many and important; indeed they
are so numerous that it were futile to attempt
to give place to any in this introductory note
beyond recalling to the mind of little American
cousins that the great Washington himself
was of a well-known English family before they
settled in America.</p>

<p>To-day, if the English are not emigrating to
America to the extent that they formerly were,
our American cousins are returning the visits,
if only for pleasure or edification, in astonishingly
growing numbers each year.</p>

<p>All this makes for a better understanding
and appreciation of each other and cements the
growing friendship of years, which in our progressive
times is a good thing not to overlook.</p>

<p>"Our Little English Cousin," then, extends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
a cordial hand of welcome, not only to her
cousins across the seas who annually make
visits to her native land, but to the stay-at-homes
as well, who have that pleasure in store
for some future time.</p>

<h2>Our Little English Cousin</h2>



<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>EDITH'S HOME ON THE THAMES</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Now</span> it is really time to get ready, is it
not, Miss Green?" exclaimed Edith, looking
up at the clock for the twentieth time during
the last half-hour, and breaking off in the
middle of the list of English kings and
queens which she was trying to commit to
memory. Which king came after Henry III.,
in that far-away time, seemed a small matter
compared to the outing which she and her
governess had planned to enjoy on the river
that lovely afternoon.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Green smiled indulgently as she
closed her book. "It does seem a shame
to remain indoors a moment longer than one
can help such a day as this. Well, I will see
Betty about the tea-things and pack them in
the basket while you are getting ready."</p>

<p>You may imagine it did not take Edith
long to put away her books; then giving her
good-natured governess a hug she skipped
off for her hat and coat.</p>

<p>"There are Eleanor and Clarence waiting
for us now," cried Edith, as she and Miss
Green, who was carrying the tea-basket,
crossed the gardens. Running over the lawn,
which stretched down to the river, she greeted
her two little playmates from the vicarage.
All three were bubbling over with glee at the
prospect of an outing this bright June afternoon
upon the river Thames. They were to
go up-stream to a pretty little nook, in a quiet
"backwater," which was a favourite spot with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
them, and have a "gipsy" tea under the
willows.</p>

<p>The children were soon seated on cushions
in the neat little shallow punt. Towser, the
big collie dog, was already in the boat, for he
knew he was a welcome companion on these
trips.</p>

<p>Miss Green, standing at one end, poled the
boat gracefully through the water. This looks
like an easy thing to do, but it takes a great
deal of skill to handle a punt.</p>

<p>"Does not the river look gay?" said
Eleanor. "There are lots of people out."
The river indeed was covered with pleasure
craft of all kinds. There is probably no stream
in the world so given up to pleasure as is the
Thames, which flows through the very heart
of England; indeed it has been called the
"River of Pleasure."</p>

<p>It took all Miss Green's skill to steer
through the many boats filled with gay parties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Daintily fitted up rowboats with soft-cushioned
seats, the ladies in their bright
summer dresses, with parasols of gay colours;
the men in white flannel suits and straw hats.
There were many punts like their own. Also
tiny sailboats, some of them with bright red or
blue sails; while every now and then a crew
of young men from one of the colleges sculled
past them, practising for the forthcoming boat-race.
All made way for these swift racing
boats, for one of the unwritten rules of the
river is that boat crews must not be interfered
with while practising.</p>

<p>Occasionally our party in the punt would
get the effect of a gentle wave from an automobile
boat or a steam-launch as it rushed by.</p>

<p>In the midst of it all were to be seen the
swans gliding in and out among the boats.
The Thames swans are as well known as the
river itself. They are very privileged birds
and directly under the protection of the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
itself. There are special keepers to
look after them, and any person who injured
a swan in any way would be punished. But
no harm ever happens to them, for the lovely
white birds are great pets with every one, and
the children especially like nothing better than
to feed them.</p>

<p>Along the banks, under the shade of overhanging
trees, were merry boat-loads of family
parties making a picnic of their afternoon tea,
as our little party intended to do.</p>

<p>You must know that everybody in England
takes what is called "five o'clock tea," and
would no more think of going without their
tea in the afternoon than their dinner.</p>

<p>Presently the punt glided behind a clump
of trees. You would think it was going into
some one's garden, but out it came into a quiet
bit of water, a miniature bay quite apart from
the main river. This is called a "backwater."
Catching hold of a tree with the hook on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
end of her pole, Miss Green brought the punt
up against the bank under the overhanging
willows, and the young people were quickly
out and on shore.</p>

<p>Then the tea-basket was brought from the
punt. "Now, Clarence," said Miss Green,
"you fill the teakettle while the girls help
me."</p>

<p>Their kettle was especially constructed for
these occasions with a hollow space in the
bottom into which fits a small spirit-lamp,&mdash;this
so the wind cannot blow out the flame.</p>

<p>"My! we have got a jolly lot of cake;
that's good," and Clarence looked very approvingly
at the nice plum-cake and the
Madeira cake, which is a sort of sponge cake
with slices of preserved citron on top of it,&mdash;a
favourite cake for teas.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the water boiled in spite
of everybody watching it attentively, and Miss
Green filled the teapot. Then they all gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
around the dainty cloth spread on the
grass, and the slices of bread and butter, known
as "cut bread and butter," and the lovely
strawberry jam quickly disappeared.</p>

<p>"Why do we always eat more out-of-doors,"
said Edith, "than when we are indoors eating
in the proper way? I suppose it is because
we are doing it for fun that it seems different
from tea in the schoolroom."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the fresh air has more to do with
it than anything else," laughed Miss Green, as
she cut them the sixth piece of cake all around.</p>

<p>"Now you rest, Miss Green, and we will
pack up everything," said Eleanor.</p>

<p>"Yes, and let's wash up the tea-things. It
will be fun," said Edith, "and Betty will be
surprised."</p>

<p>So the little girls amused themselves with
their housekeeping, while Clarence and Towser
ran races up and down the greensward
until it was time to return.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">OLDHAM MANOR</span>
</div>

<p>The sun was setting when they pulled up at
the steps of their boat-landing where Colonel
and Mrs. Howard, Edith's parents, were sitting
in comfortable wicker garden-chairs, waiting
for them.</p>

<p>Oldham Manor, Edith's home, was a fine
old house built in the "Tudor" style, of red
brick with stone doorways and windows, and
quaint, tall, ornamental chimneys, with the
lower story entirely covered with ivy.</p>

<p>Colonel Howard was a retired army officer
who had seen much service in far-away India.
He had to leave the army on account of his
health, and now devoted himself to his wife
and two children, and his lovely home. Mrs.
Howard herself was a handsome and stately
woman, rather reserved in her manner, but
devoted to her children.</p>

<p>Tom, Edith's brother, was at school at
Eton College, so Edith had a double share of
petting, and led a very happy existence with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
plenty of work and plenty of play. She had
a pretty little room, with a little brass bed,
and an old-fashioned chest of drawers for her
clothes. The little dressing-table, which stood
in front of one of the windows, was draped
with pink-flowered muslin, and the window
curtains were of the same material. The
chairs were covered with a bright, pretty pink,
green, and white chintz, and the carpet was
pale green with pink roses.</p>

<p>From the window of this delightful room,
one overlooked the rose-garden. Adjoining
was the schoolroom, a big room where Miss
Green and Edith spent much of their time.</p>

<p>Edith usually dressed quickly, for, when the
weather was fine, she and her papa always took
a walk around the gardens before breakfast.
Colonel Howard was very proud of his roses,
and the rose garden of the manor was quite
famous; many of the rose-bushes were trained
to form great arches over the walks.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Another hobby of Colonel Howard's was
his fancy chickens and ducks, of which he had
a great variety. Edith had her pet chickens,
too, and she and her papa could never agree as
to whose chickens were the finest, when they
went to feed them in the morning.</p>

<p>Edith would run each morning into the
breakfast-room, a bright-faced little girl with
sparkling blue eyes and golden brown hair
tied up with a pink ribbon and waving loosely
over her shoulders&mdash;as all English girls wear
their hair until they are quite young ladies.
Her dress was very simply made, and around
the neck was a pink ribbon&mdash;pink was her
favourite colour&mdash;tied in a bow. There was
a "good-morning kiss" for mamma, and Edith
must help to fasten the rose in her hair, which
Colonel Howard always brought his wife.</p>

<p>Edith had a good appetite for her breakfast
of porridge and cream, milk, eggs and toast,
or fish, or perhaps grilled kidneys and tomatoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
which is a favourite English breakfast
dish and very good indeed. Always she finished
with marmalade.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, then came the lessons in the
schoolroom until one o'clock, when Edith and
Miss Green had their dinner served to them
here. After dinner she was free to walk or
drive with her papa and mamma, or Miss
Green, or play games with her little friends in
the neighbourhood. Then for an hour in the
afternoon Edith studied her lessons for the
next day, curled up on the big green sofa near
the window, while Miss Green read or sewed
beside her, ready to help her out with a hard
word. Finally she had tea with Miss Green
in the schoolroom at six o'clock, and soon
after this was ready for bed.</p>

<p>Thursday was a red-letter day for Edith, for
in the afternoon she always took tea with
mamma and papa in state, in the drawing-room.
This was so that she should learn how to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
through with it in the proper manner, which
is a very important part of a little English
girl's education. Mamma received her just as
if she was a grown-up lady visitor, while Edith
put on her real "company" manners, and
Colonel and Mrs. Howard often could scarcely
repress a smile at her great dignity when she
began the conversation with, "It's a charming
day, is it not." "I take two lumps of sugar
only, thank you." Rainy afternoons she often
worked on fancy articles for the bazaars held
by the Children's League of Mercy. Edith
was a member, and the money from the sales
was given to help the very poor children in
their neighbourhood. So the little girl's days
passed pleasantly enough, as you may imagine.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A DAY AT HAMPTON COURT</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">No</span>, Towser, you can't come with us; you
know you will not be allowed to go into the
palace, and what should we do with you then,"
said Edith, patting him on the head, as she
closed the gate and left poor doggie looking
wistfully after them.</p>

<p>Edith had been looking forward to a visit to
Hampton Court for some time. Her mamma
had promised that she could invite Eleanor
and Clarence Whitworth and that Miss Green
would take them all to spend a Saturday half-holiday,
or rather a whole holiday, at this
beautiful old palace, which was on the river,
not very far distant from Oldham Manor.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Several Saturdays had proved disappointingly
rainy, but to-day was all they could wish
for, and after calling at the vicarage for Eleanor
and Clarence, they went down the little village
street which led to the river landing, where
there was a sign, "Boats to let."</p>

<p>Miss Green intended to engage a waterman
to row them up to the Court, as it was a rather
long and tiresome pull.</p>

<p>The Thames watermen are quite an institution,
and are one of the oldest of English
guilds or societies. They are banded together
for the mutual protection of their business,
which is to hire out boats&mdash;and to row boats
and the like. Each man wears a badge, and is
very jealous of his rights. A new man who
wishes to join their band must go through a
long apprenticeship before he can become what
is publicly known as a "Thames Waterman."</p>

<p>"Good morning, John," said Miss Green,
to a bluff, good-natured man who lifted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
cap to them. "Have you a good boat for us to-day?
we want you to take us up to the Court."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">
<img src="images/i035.jpg" width="409" height="600" alt="family gettingout of boat" />
<span class="caption">&quot;IN A FEW MINUTES THEY HAD LANDED&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Yes, indeed, miss, one of the best of the
lot." John was their favourite waterman, who
often rowed them when the distances were too
great for Miss Green.</p>

<p>It was a pretty row past the green lawns of
handsome homes, and one or two small river
villages, where the principal business is the
letting of boats and of fishing-tackle.</p>

<p>John's sturdy strokes soon brought them in
sight of the park belonging to Hampton Court,
surrounded by a high wall past which the river
winds for some distance. Soon they caught
sight of the red brick towers of the palace
itself, and its beautiful gardens, and in a few
minutes they had landed near one of the small
excursion steamers that ply between London
and Hampton Court, on which so many folk
take a charming day's excursion on the
Thames.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>There is also a little village at Hampton
Court, as well as the palace, but one never
pays much attention to it, except when one
begins to get hungry, for it is mostly made
up of little shops, that hang out signs on which
is the one word, "Teas," which means one can
get there their afternoon tea.</p>

<p>Our little party made straight for the big
iron gates which lead into the entrance court.
On one side are barracks where soldiers live,
and before them rises the red brick lodge or
gateway through which is the main entrance
to the palace itself.</p>

<p>I fancy one often thinks of a palace as a
great, tall, imposing building of many stories.
Well, most palaces <i>do</i> cover a great deal of
ground, but many of the English ones are not
so very tall. This palace is only two stories
high, with a sort of attic at the top. Another
strange thing about these old-time palaces is
that most of the rooms are very small according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to our modern ideas, except for a
few long rooms, called galleries.</p>

<p>"Let us go through the two courtyards into
the gardens and sit on a bench under one of
those old yew-trees, and I will tell you children
something of the story of the palace;
then you will enjoy seeing it much more,"
said Miss Green, as she led them into the
lovely gardens where they could see the
building to the best advantage. The children
crowded around her as she began:</p>

<p>"It was built several hundred years ago by
the great Cardinal Wolsey who was minister
or councillor to King Henry VIII. Wolsey
became a powerful favourite of the king, who
loaded him with royal gifts. He became
wealthy and proud, and built for himself many
grand homes, until at last he founded this
Hampton Court, which was to be the most
splendid of them all. But the cardinal had
become by this time such a power in the kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and was so arrogant and wealthy that
the king was jealous of him, fearing that the
cardinal would become his rival.</p>

<p>"To counteract this, the cardinal presented
his palace at Hampton Court to the king,
and so it became a royal palace. But this did
not prevent the cardinal's downfall.</p>

<p>"Until a hundred or more years ago this
palace was a favourite home of the Royal
Family, but now it is only a show-place for
holiday-makers."</p>

<p>"I don't see how the king could have
treated the poor cardinal badly after he gave
him such a beautiful home," remarked Edith,
as they entered the palace.</p>

<p>"Ah, well! perhaps he deserved it," said
Miss Green, as they went up the grand stairway
and through room after room filled with
pictures, and some of the furniture of those
old days.</p>

<p>They could see the beds on which had slept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
many royal persons. Around this furniture
were drawn ropes so no one could touch it
or sit upon the chairs. The floors were highly
waxed, and in every room was a guardian or
sort of policeman, who closely watched visitors
to see that nothing was disturbed.</p>

<p>"Well, they did have a great number of
rooms," said Eleanor, after they had walked
through many bedchambers, anterooms, and
reception-rooms.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Miss Green, "they were
necessary not only for the Royal Family
itself, but for the many people who were
always attached to the court.</p>

<p>"Here is the 'throne-room,'" she continued,
"where the king or queen sat in that
gilt chair which stands on a dais or platform
raised several steps above the floor." Above
the chair was a velvet canopy surmounted by
a gilt crown. Usually the arms of England
(the "Lion and the Unicorn") were embroidered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
in gold and coloured silks on the velvet
background behind the throne. Here the
kings and queens held their audiences, and
saw those who wished to present some petition
or ask some royal favour.</p>

<p>"This is one of the most splendid old-time
'banqueting-halls' in our country," said Miss
Green, as they came into the great chamber
with a high roof of great carved wood beams
and windows of coloured glass. Around the
walls were great stag heads, and over the
entrance door was a gallery where the musicians
played while guests ate dinner at the
long tables. The guests sat on wooden
benches or stools, while the persons of high
rank occupied chairs at a table at the end of
the hall, which was placed on a raised platform
which separated them from those of inferior
rank.</p>

<p>"Can't we see the big grape-vine now?"
said Edith, as they left the palace itself.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Green led the way through the rose-garden,
and past Queen Mary's Bower, a
shady and favourite walk of one of the
queens, so shut in by trees that it looked
like a green tunnel. "There is the vine-house,"
exclaimed Clarence, as they came to
a long, low, glass house which covered the
huge vine, nearly two hundred years old, the
largest single vine in the world. The trunk
looked like that of a small tree, and its
branches, hanging thick with bunches of
grapes, covered the glass roof. At various
times its home had to be added to, and still
the vine has to be constantly pruned to keep
it within bounds.</p>

<p>"I should like to eat some of those grapes
when they are ripe," said Eleanor, looking up
at the clusters over her head.</p>

<p>"You would have to be one of the Royal
Family to do that," Miss Green smilingly said.
"They are all kept for the king's own use."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, are you young people ready for
dinner?" asked the governess, looking at her
watch as they left the vine-house. "It is
nearly one o'clock, so we had better have our
dinner, and then we can spend the afternoon
in the gardens and park."</p>

<p>"Afterward we can go through the Maze,
Eleanor," cried Edith, as, holding each other
by the hand, the little girls skipped through
the garden paths.</p>

<p>"Yes, but dinner first, by all means," said
Clarence, "and let us go to one of the places
on the river, please, Miss Green, where we can
watch the boats."</p>

<p>On the gallery of one of the inns that overlook
the river they found a round table that
would just accommodate their party. Here
they could enjoy a fine view of the palace
and the river, and a substantial meal at the
same time.</p>

<p>"Now for the 'Maze,'" cried the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
people, when they entered the gardens again.
The "Maze" is an elaborate labyrinth, whose
pattern is laid out in high-clipped hedges of
box-trees. One can lose themselves for some
time amid its tangle of paths before it is possible
to reach the centre, and come back again
to the starting-place.</p>

<p>"By paying a penny I can watch your
efforts," said Miss Green, as she paid her
penny to the guardian, and mounted a little
platform which overlooks the tangle of paths.
"I think I shall enjoy this more than rushing
around through the hot sun," she said, smiling
down on her charges.</p>

<p>Finding the right path through the Maze is
one of the favourite amusements of the children
when they visit Hampton Court, and our
three young friends were soon rushing around
laughing in the wildest excitement.</p>

<p>It took nearly an hour's fun before they
were able to reach the centre and get out again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Clarence being rather crestfallen that the girls
had beaten him out.</p>

<p>"Oh, we <i>are</i> warm," said Edith, as they ran
up to Miss Green, panting and fanning their
faces with their hats.</p>

<p>"Indeed you are. Come, and we will rest
and cool off in the park. The chestnut-trees
look lovely with their spikes of white flowers."</p>

<p>Under the great trees, groups of children
were playing about, or having picnic lunches,
or amusing themselves with the deer, which
live in the park, and are so used to visitors
that they are very tame, and will even eat out
of one's hand.</p>

<p>"I should like to come here next Sunday;
it will be 'Chestnut Sunday'" said Clarence,
as they threw themselves on the soft
grass.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Edith, "that is always one of
the first Sundays in May."</p>

<p>"Yes," continued Clarence, "the first Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
after the chestnut-trees come in full
blossom."</p>

<p>Thousands of people come here from London
and the surrounding country on that day,
that they may drive through this long avenue
that leads directly through the park to the
palace and admire the display of blossoms on
the great trees that line the avenue on both
sides.</p>

<p>Clarence grew enthusiastic. "It's a jolly
sight, I can tell you, to see vehicles of all
kinds, from bicycles and coster's carts to big
four-in-hand coaches and automobiles. There
is such a jam on the avenue that they can only
creep along; it's like a big picnic."</p>

<p>"Is it not nearly tea-time? We are so
thirsty, Miss Green," said Eleanor, as the sun
began to drop behind the trees. The little
girls had amused themselves by making endless
daisy chains, and decorating their hats with the
"may" as they call the hawthorn-bloom, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Miss Green read to them from a story-book.</p>

<p>"Yes, we must not be too late in getting
home; we will stop at one of the little tea-shops
near the boat-landing."</p>

<p>It was a neat little cottage which they selected,
covered with vines, with a small flower-garden
in front. The pleasant-faced hostess
soon brought in a big tea-tray covered with a
dainty cloth on which was a big pot of tea, cut
bread and butter, and delicious strawberries,
such as only grow in England. "Nearly as
big as my fist," declared Clarence, but this
was perhaps putting it rather strongly, though
each one made a big mouthful as the young
folk ate them, dipping them first into sugar.</p>

<p>They sang songs as they rowed home, and
the tunes were taken up by other boats full
of young people out for the Saturday half-holiday.</p>

<p>"We have had such a lovely time; thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
you so much, Miss Green," said the young
Whitworths as they parted at their gate.</p>

<p>"It <i>has</i> been a nice day, and we will have
some others, too, when Adelaide comes, won't
we?" said Edith.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>A DRIVE TO RICHMOND AND KEW GARDENS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Adelaide Stamford</span> was Edith's first cousin
and lived in London. She was not as strong
as Edith, and during the winter her mamma had
taken her to Brighton, which is the great
winter seaside resort. Although it is also a
very fashionable place, many invalids go there
to enjoy the warm sunshine. Adelaide was
taken up and down the fine promenade in a
bath chair, which is a kind of big baby-carriage
which a man pulls, or pushes along. She also
sat in the glass "shelters" along the sea front,
which keep off the wind nicely, and are like
small glass houses.</p>

<p>So Adelaide had become much stronger, but
the smoky London fog had again made her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
rather pale and thin, and so she was coming to
spend a few weeks with the Howards, to see
if Surrey air would not be beneficial.</p>

<p>She was Edith's favourite cousin, and the
little girls were nearly of the same age. Edith
looked forward to having her share her lessons,
and planned many pleasant drives together in
their neighbourhood, which is one of the most
beautiful and interesting in England.</p>

<p>"My dear, we must not only have roses in
our garden, we must get some into your
cheeks," said Colonel Howard, as he lifted
a little pale-faced girl with dark hair and eyes
out of the dog-cart which had brought her
from the station.</p>

<p>"She must stay out-of-doors as much as
possible, and on the river, and Edith will take
her on some of her favourite drives, and we
will soon have her looking as plump as our
little girl," said her aunt as she kissed her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Howard then took Adelaide up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Edith's room, where another bed had been put
up for her.</p>

<p>"Kate will arrange your things in their
proper places," said Mrs. Howard, as the neat-capped
maid came to take her coat and hat.
"I must leave you now, we are very busy.
Edith has probably told you that the 'Sunday-school
treat' is to be held on our lawn this
afternoon, so, when you have rested, come
into the garden and help us amuse the little
ones."</p>

<p>"A treat" in other words is a picnic, and
often only an afternoon picnic, as in this case.
The children of the neighbourhood had early
gathered in the churchyard, and were marshalled
by the vicar and their teachers into a
procession.</p>

<p>Marching two by two, they came down the
street, and through the big gates of the manor,
where they quickly spread themselves in merry
groups over the lawns. Soon everybody was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in full swing for a good time; games were
started, and Clarence with some of the older
boys put up a cricket-pitch in one corner of
the grounds. The croquet lawn was also well
patronized.</p>

<p>Colonel Howard had generously arranged
for a small steam-launch to take the children
for short trips up the river and back again;
this was perhaps more popular than anything
else.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Howard and Mrs. Whitworth
superintended the setting of the tables
on the grass under gay red and white awnings.</p>

<p>The summons to tea was welcome, and the
children joyfully gathered around the well-filled
tables. There were huge plates of sandwiches,
cakes, buns, jam, and big strawberries.
All the good things melted away so quickly
that it kept the older folks running to bring
more, while nobody stopped to count the cups
of tea that each one stowed away.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a little lull after this, while they
listened to a band of music placed under the
trees.</p>

<p>Adelaide greatly enjoyed it; it was more of
a novelty to her than her cousin, and she was
much interested in helping feed the swans, who
had evidently got wind of the entertainment
and knew that their chances for food were good.
A number of these graceful birds had gathered
along the river bank, and the children were
stuffing them with pieces of buns. There was
one greedy old swan that amused them very
much; he was always trying to peck the more
timid ones away and gobble up everything
himself, just like some greedy children we all
have seen.</p>

<p>The twilight was closing in when the last
band of young people left, singing songs, and
waving their hats and handkerchiefs; all of
them very grateful for the happy time they
had enjoyed so much.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Green says if we are very good she
will take us for a drive in the governess-cart
to Richmond and Kew Gardens this afternoon,"
Edith confidentially whispered to
Adelaide, as they went up to the schoolroom
the next day. Lessons were learned as by
magic that morning, and Tony and the cart
were at the door early in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Tony was one of the dearest of ponies, and
was almost as much of a playmate with the
children as Towser.</p>

<p>"Look at Tony as we get in, Adelaide; he
has the funniest little way of looking around
at you." Sure enough, Tony was peering
around at them as much as to say, "I'm
watching you; aren't you almost ready to
start?"</p>

<p>They halted a moment at the vicarage to
arrange that Eleanor and Clarence should
meet them at the bird-pond in Kew Gardens.
Soon they were driving through the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Richmond Park. Miss Green pointed out
White Lodge, one of the many royal residences;
a rather small, plain, white house in
the centre of the park. "It was here," she
continued, "that young Prince Edward, the
eldest son of the Prince of Wales, who will
some day be King of England, was born.
His birthday was celebrated by a great dinner
which was given by the late Queen Victoria to
all the children of Richmond. Tables were
set under the trees in the old park, at which
hundreds of children feasted, and speeches
were made in honour of the young prince.
Afterward each child was given a mug, on
which was a picture of the queen and the
date, which they could always keep as a
souvenir, or remembrance, of the day."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Miss Green," said Edith, "you
remember that Betty's little sister has one of
the mugs, and Betty once showed it to me."</p>

<p>"Look at the deer, Adelaide," said Edith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
as she caught her cousin by the hand. "See,
they want to cross the road, and are waiting
for us to go past." Sure enough, there stood,
watching the cart, a great herd of these graceful
creatures, very erect, with their dainty heads
crowned with big, branching horns. They
were evidently undecided whether or not they
had time enough to cross the road before the
cart would reach them; then one made up his
mind and darted across, another followed, and
then the entire herd swept swiftly by, then
turned again to look at the cart, as much as
to say, "Well, we did it."</p>

<p>"Here is the famous view from Richmond
Hill, known all over the world," said Miss
Green, as she pulled up Tony for a few minutes,
that the girls might admire the winding
River Thames, far below them, lying like
a silver ribbon between green meadows and
wooded hills. "Authors and artists alike
have helped to make this view celebrated,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
said Miss Green, "and that big building on
the left is the famous 'Star and Garter' hotel.
It used to be the fashion to drive down from
London and lunch on its terrace, from which
one gets a most beautiful view down the
Thames valley."</p>

<p>Edith was trying to point out to Adelaide
the tower of Windsor Castle, where the king
and the Royal Family live when they are not
in London. "We will go over there some
day while you are with us, Adelaide."</p>

<p>"Miss Green," continued Edith, as the
pony trotted down the long, narrow street
into the town, "won't you please stop at the
'Maid of Honor' shop, so we can buy some
cakes?"</p>

<p>"I can never get Edith past this place,"
laughed Miss Green, as she pulled up in front
of an old-fashioned shop, painted green, with
a big sign over the front: "<span class="smcap">The Original
Maid of Honor Shop</span>."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>While the little girls make their purchases
you might like to hear the story of these
famous cakes.</p>

<p>It is said they were first made for King
Henry VIII., by one of the Maids of Honor
at his court, and this is why they are called
"Maid of Honor" cakes. A <i>Maid of Honor</i>
is not really a maid or a servant, but a lady
who attends upon the queen&mdash;a companion.</p>

<p>Well, the king thought the cakes tasted so
good that many more were made for him, and
the recipe was kept safely guarded in a fine
chest with a gold lock and key; but somehow
it became known, and was handed down until
it became the property of the present owner
of the shop, who claims that his cakes are
still made by the same recipe as those eaten
by King Henry hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p>By this time the little girls were driving
past the "Green." Every town and village in
England has an open grass plot which is either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
called the "Green" or the "Common," which
means that it is common property, and it is
here that the young people play games.</p>

<p>"There is all that is left of Richmond
Palace," said Miss Green, pointing to an
ancient gateway with a part of a dwelling
attached. "Once it was a favourite residence
of the great Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>"Many great men lived during the reign of
'Good Queen Bess,' as she was called, but
you must not forget the greatest of them all&mdash;Shakespeare."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Edith, "papa and mamma
are going this summer to visit the village where
he lived, and they have promised to take me.
What is the name of the place, Miss Green? I
have forgotten it."</p>

<p>"Stratford-on-Avon, and you must never
forget the name of the town where lived the
greatest English poet, my dear," replied Miss
Green.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did not a great many kings and queens
live in Richmond, besides Queen Elizabeth?"
asked Adelaide.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a favourite home of royalty,
and that is why it was called 'Royal Richmond,'
and the town has always been proud of the
numbers of great people who have lived here,
poets and writers and painters as well as kings
and queens.</p>

<p>"I will have the cart put up at one of the
little inns near the big gates," said Miss Green,
as they drove up to the entrance to Kew
Gardens.</p>

<p>Soon our party were strolling over the soft
grass and among the lovely flower-beds, for
here people can walk and play over the grass as
they like, for there are no horrid "Keep
off the Grass" signs.</p>

<p>If you want to know what any plant or tree
in the whole world looks like, you have only
to come here and you will find a specimen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
it, either growing out in the open, or in the
museum, which makes these gardens of great
value. They were begun first by a certain
King George, whose palace is still standing
in one corner of the gardens, and who afterward
made it a present to the nation.</p>

<p>Our party made straight for the pond where
they were to meet their little friends.</p>

<p>"There they are now," cried Edith, "and
Clarence is feeding that funny old bird that
follows everybody around."</p>

<p>"I have given this old fellow two buns
already, and he is still begging for more," said
Clarence, as the two little girls ran up.</p>

<p>It is a great treat for the children to watch
the queer water-birds from all parts of the
world whose homes are in and around this
pond.</p>

<p>On Saturday afternoons especially, numbers
of young people of all ages gather there at the
hour when the birds are fed. The birds are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
petted and fed so much that they are very
tame, and the gray gull that Clarence was
talking about, follows every one about begging
like a kitten or a dog. There are ducks of all
kinds, and all colours, that scoot over the
water, swallowing the unwary flies and waterbugs
who stray in their path, and dive for the
bits of cake and bread which are thrown to
them by the children. There are beautiful
red flamingos, and storks that stand on one
leg with their heads under one wing, and all
kinds of queer birds with long, stick-like legs.
But the funniest of all are the big white
pelicans.</p>

<p>"Do look at them," cried Adelaide, "they
know their dinner is coming." The five
pelicans had been huddled up in a bunch in
one corner, with their eyes tight shut, one
might think fast asleep. Just then the keeper
came down to the water's edge with a big basket
of fish. Such a flapping of wings! The pelicans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
were instantly wide-awake, and, rushing
forward, crowded about the keeper, opening
their enormously long beaks, to which is
attached a kind of natural sack or bag which
they use for holding their food until they can
better masticate it.</p>

<p>As each one's share of the fish was tossed
into its big mouth, it disappeared like lightning.
Meanwhile, all the other birds, big and
little, had rushed up demanding their share.
Such "quacks" and "gowks" and "squeaks"!
You never heard such a funny lot of voices.
The greedy old gull hopped right under the
keeper's feet, until he got the biggest fish of
all, and dragged it off into a corner all by
himself.</p>

<p>Our young people watched the birds for
some time, then went through some of the big
greenhouses full of palms, and all sorts of
tropical plants, and finally drove back home
through the quaint little village of Kew.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"In this churchyard is buried one of our
most famous painters," said Miss Green, as
they passed the quaint church which stands on
one side of the Kew Green,&mdash;"Gainsborough,
who was especially fond of painting portraits
of beautiful women. But we must not stop
longer, as it is growing late," she continued,
so touching up Tony, they went along all in
high spirits, though Adelaide confessed she
did feel a bit tired, and both the little girls
were quite ready for their tea when they
reached the manor.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>WITH TOM AT WINDSOR CASTLE AND ETON</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">When</span> do we start, papa, and which way
are we to go, and are we to see Tom first,
or the castle?" asked Edith, all in one
breath, as soon as she had kissed her mamma
and papa good morning in the breakfast-room.</p>

<p>"Oh, you little fidget!" said Colonel
Howard, good-naturedly, "sit down and eat
your breakfast and we will try and answer
one question at a time. Now, which would
you rather see first, Tom or the castle?"</p>

<p>"Tom, of course," cried Edith, without
hesitation, for she and her brother were great
chums, though she was only a little girl, while
in her eyes, as well as in his own, Master
Tom was quite a man.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then, Tom first, and we will take
him to the castle with us. Though he has
been there before, he will enjoy the day with us.</p>

<p>"We will drive along the river road, for
that is the prettiest way, though the longest,
and we will start as soon as mamma is ready.
Now, miss, all of your questions are satisfactorily
answered, and it only remains for
you children not to keep us waiting."</p>

<p>There was no danger of that. The young
people were in the carriage before Colonel and
Mrs. Howard came down-stairs, and soon
they were bowling along the shady road, the
hawthorn hedges on either side perfuming
the air with their white blossoms.</p>

<p>They passed through several quaint little
riverside villages with queer little inns, where
those who want to fish or boat on the river
go for a lunch or tea, which they can enjoy on
a gallery, or in a garden overlooking the water.</p>

<p>"There's Windsor Castle," cried Edith.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
"I knew it from the pictures; it is a real
story-book castle." And, sure enough, high
up over the trees rose the great gray towers
and walls at whose very base flowed the
Thames.</p>

<p>"There is one of the most historic spots
on our river," said Colonel Howard, pointing
to a small island covered with trees. "It
does not look very important, but tradition
says a great event took place there. Way
back in the early history of our country the
kings had such absolute power that they could
do almost anything they liked, and if they
were not good men this led them to oppress
their subjects and take away their liberties.
So the great barons of the country forced
King John to give them their 'Charter,' on
this little island, called Runnymede. All this
is difficult for you little girls to understand,
but some day you will read more about it
in your history."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can see, Edith, over those meadows
yonder, where Tom lives. That is Eton, and
this is one of the prettiest views of the college,"
said Mrs. Howard.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were among the old
buildings of the most famous of boys' schools,
and found Tom ready for them, full of enthusiasm
at the prospect of a day off in company
with his family.</p>

<p>The Howard family was a very devoted one,
and no wonder they were proud of Tom. He
was a fine, healthy, rosy-cheeked boy with
frank, blue eyes and short-clipped brown hair.
He had on a suit like that worn by all the
Eton boys, which has now become the proper
dress for English boys of certain ages, especially
schoolboys. It consists of long gray
trousers and a short black jacket, coming just
to the waist, known as the "Eton jacket";
over this is a broad white collar, and they
wear with this costume a high silk hat, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
like the one your papa wears, except of course
it is smaller.</p>

<p>"I wrote to you that I was in the 'eights'
that is to row at Henley, papa; well, we are
working hard to beat them. By Jove! we
have got a strict coach; he is keeping the
fellows up to the mark," and Tom talked on
with enthusiasm about the boat-races at Henley-on-Thames,
at which their crew of eight
was to compete for one of the prizes known
as "The Ladies' Plate."</p>

<p>As he talked, he led them through the
colleges and into the chapel, pointing out
everything to the little girls with a lofty air
of proprietorship which greatly impressed
them with his importance, and when he
showed them the "playing fields" where
cricket was going on, and spoke in an offhand
manner of "our men," the little girls
looked at him with great awe and admiration.</p>

<p>It was all new to Edith and Adelaide, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Tom took them through some of the old
class-rooms, where many celebrated men had
learned their lessons. The rough, wooden
benches and desks had been hacked and cut up
by the knives of schoolboys for many hundred
years. It used to be the fashion for the boys
to cut their names somewhere on the oak-panelled
walls of their schoolrooms, and many
names that have since become famous can be
seen there to-day. The boys liked to do it all
the more, because it was forbidden, but gradually
it became the custom, and the proper thing
to do.</p>

<p>After Tom had duly impressed the glories
of his school upon his sister and cousin, the
whole party set out for Windsor Castle, just
across the river from Eton.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were climbing the
hill on which the castle stands, and the carriage
stopped at the big entrance gate, on either
side of which stands a sentry in a bright red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
coat and a great bearskin helmet on his
head.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 418px;">
<img src="images/i073.jpg" width="418" height="600" alt="children beside river wtih castle in the background" />
<span class="caption">WINDSOR CASTLE</span>
</div>

<p>"Now, my dears, you are really inside the
king's home," said Colonel Howard, as with
some other visitors they followed the guide
through the handsome rooms, with their elegant
furniture and valuable pictures. From
the windows was a fine view extending many
miles over the great park which surrounds the
castle.</p>

<p>"On certain days of the week," said Colonel
Howard, "a band plays on the terrace below,
and then the grounds and terrace are free to
all who wish to come, while the Royal Family
often sit at these windows and enjoy the
music."</p>

<p>They also visited the beautiful chapel, where
the king and his family attend service when
they are at the castle.</p>

<p>Soon our party came to meet the carriage
again outside the great gateway. "Drive to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
'White Swan,' John," said Colonel Howard,
"we are going to lunch there."</p>

<p>"That's good," said Tom. "It's a jolly nice
place; they will give us a good dinner. Look,
papa," he continued, excitedly, "there is
Prince Eddie and his brother in that carriage
coming toward us. I knew they were staying
at 'Frogmore House.'"</p>

<p>The two boy princes, manly-looking young
boys, dressed in sailor suits, were chattering
gaily with their tutor, who accompanied them,
and smilingly returned the bows of Colonel
Howard's party as they passed.</p>

<p>They are the two oldest sons of the Prince
of Wales; they are fine-looking little fellows,
and enjoy nothing better than their home life
in the country, cycling around Windsor Park,
or fishing and boating on the river.</p>

<p>Our little party enjoyed a bountiful dinner
in the cool dining-room of the "White Swan
Inn," with its dark, oak-panelled walls, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
big sideboard, set out with fine old silver
and china.</p>

<p>The solemn, smooth-faced old waiter deftly
served them. First they had a delicious fried
sole, and then the dish without which no
English person thinks dinner is complete,&mdash;a
big joint of good English roast beef, which
as a matter of fact mostly comes from Scotland.</p>

<p>With the roast beef there are potatoes and
vegetables. Afterward there was a pudding,
for a real English dinner must always finish
with pudding. Then follows cheese, which is
eaten with salad, the salad being usually lettuce
and eaten only with salt. Sometimes they
have coffee after dinner, but the English are
not great coffee drinkers. You must have
found out by this time that they are much
more fond of tea.</p>

<p>"Let's go for a row on the river," was the
first suggestion after they had left the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and were seated in the garden of the inn, from
Tom, who was eager to show his skill in
handling the oars.</p>

<p>"I am sure your mother and I prefer to
rest awhile; we are not so keen for exertion
just after dinner," said Colonel Howard, "but
you can take the two girls, only don't go too
far, for we have a long ride before us."</p>

<p>So the young people enjoyed a half-hour's
row; then Tom was driven back to his school,
all promising to meet again at Henley.</p>

<p>It was the cool of the evening when John
drove through the manor gates, and needless
to say our two little girls slept that night like
tops. Somehow this toy has the reputation of
being a very sound sleeper. Can somebody
explain why?</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>LONDON&mdash;HYDE PARK AND WESTMINSTER
ABBEY</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Adelaide's</span> visit to Oldham Manor was at
an end, and Edith was to return with her to
spend a week in London. You can imagine
how excited she was at the thought of all she
would see in the great city.</p>

<p>Adelaide was so much improved by her stay
in the country that she seemed quite another
little girl who waved good-bye to her good uncle
and aunt as the train pulled out of the little
railway station. Miss Green was to see them
safely to the end of their journey and return
again the same day.</p>

<p>"Does not London look smoky and dark?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
exclaimed Edith, as their cab took them swiftly
through the crowded streets.</p>

<p>"And this, too, is a very fair day for London,"
said Miss Green, "but here we are in
Langham Gardens," as the cab turned into a
square with a small park, or garden, in the centre,
around which were substantial houses. Much
of London is built around such little squares.
Soon the cab stopped before a comfortable brick
house of four stories with white stone trimmings.</p>

<p>In front of each window was what is called
a window-garden, an ornamental box full of
bright flowering plants. All the better class
London dwellings have these window-gardens,
which do so much toward brightening up the
gloomy rows of houses. The front door was
a rich green in colour and in the centre was a
big brass knocker. A few hard raps brought
the maid, and Adelaide was soon in her mother's
arms, who was greatly pleased at seeing her
looking so well.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take Edith to your room, my dear," said
Mrs. Stamford, "and do not be long, for lunch
will soon be ready."</p>

<p>Adelaide's room was a very nice one, but
one could not see the flowers and river from its
windows, as from Edith's in Surrey. They
looked over endless roof-tops and smoking
chimneys. Opening out of it was a sort of
play-room and schoolroom combined. Here
Adelaide had her lessons with her teacher, who
came every day for that purpose.</p>

<p>"Oh, Fluff, lazy fellow, there you are,"
cried Adelaide, as a beautiful white Persian cat
slowly uncurled himself from the depths of an
armchair and came toward them with great
deliberation, like the aristocratic pussy that he
was. He knew his own value, and had evidently
made up his mind that he would not
show his little mistress how delighted he was
to get her back again, for fear of compromising
his dignity.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is not he a beauty, Edith?" said Adelaide,
stroking his long, silky, white fur. Fluff, having
at last given in, mounted to her shoulder,
and settled there with a soft murmur of purrs.</p>

<p>"He comes of a fine family, I can tell you,
and at the last Royal Cat Show, at the Crystal
Palace, he took a gold medal; there it is hanging
up in the cabinet. There is no use trying
to keep it tied on Fluff, he only tries to lick it
off all the time; besides, it would spoil his
beautiful ruff."</p>

<p>The two little girls had lunch with Mrs.
Stamford, for Adelaide had all her meals in the
big dining-room, except tea, which she had with
her teacher, Miss Winton, in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stamford was a widow and Adelaide
her only child, so she and her mother were
much together and were real companions to
each other.</p>

<p>"How would you and Edith like to go
with me to Hyde Park this afternoon?" asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Mrs. Stamford. "The king is to open the
new Royal Hospital, and as the procession
passes through the park you will be able to see
it well."</p>

<p>"How splendid! We will really see the
king and queen, aunty? Do let's go," and
Edith jumped up and down in her chair with
excitement.</p>

<p>"Be ready, then, so that we can leave directly
after lunch, for he is to pass Albert Gate at
three o'clock, and we must be early to get
a place."</p>

<p>The park looked gayer than usual this afternoon,
with plenty of well-dressed people in
fine carriages drawn by well-groomed horses
and driven by pompous coachmen; some of
the handsomest carriages had coachmen and
footmen in bright-coloured liveries and powdered
wigs. A carriage like this you may be
sure held some grand person. All along the
edge of the drives were rows of chairs; toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
these Mrs. Stamford made her way and selected
three in the front row.</p>

<p>Presently one of the men who have the
seats in charge came up, and Mrs. Stamford
paid him a penny for the use of each seat.</p>

<p>The crowd grew more dense and the big
policemen were now keeping the driveway
clear.</p>

<p>Edith had noticed in the two chairs next to
her a little girl, apparently but little older than
herself, and a boy evidently younger. They
had been talking eagerly together, and Edith
could tell that everything was new and strange
to them.</p>

<p>Presently the little girl, who had been glancing
at Edith, leaned over and said, eagerly:
"They will soon be here, won't they? I so
much want to see a real live king and queen.
You know we don't have kings and queens in
our country. We are Americans. My mamma's
name is Mrs. White and I am Carrie White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and Henry is my youngest brother. I have
two brothers at home in New York older
than myself, and we are staying at the Hotel
Cecil."</p>

<p>The little girl poured out her information
rapidly, before Edith had time to say a word.</p>

<p>"We have a 'President' in our country; he
drives around in processions, too, but he does
not wear a crown like your king," chimed in
the little boy. "I wish he was going to have
it on to-day, but I suppose he only puts it on
for grand occasions."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Adelaide, joining in the conversation,
"he wears it when he goes to open Parliament.
I saw that procession once. It was a
fine sight, better than this will be, because he
and the queen rode in the great gilded coach
that cost ever so much money. They both
had on their crowns and rich red robes trimmed
with ermine, and they smiled and bowed as
they drove along. The coach was drawn by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
eight beautiful cream-coloured horses with
harness of red and gold, and each horse was
led by a groom dressed in a red uniform with
a powdered wig and black velvet cap. Behind
were two footmen, also in red and gold, and
on either side of the carriage walked the
'Beefeaters,' as the Yeomen of the Guard
are called."</p>

<p>"Oh, those are the men who take care of
the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London.
We saw them," broke in the little boy.</p>

<p>"Yes," hurriedly went on Adelaide, "and
before the coach rode a detachment of the
Royal Horse Guards. Oh, they are splendid!
And behind rode some more Horse Guards;
then followed lots of carriages."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stamford had been listening to the
children with some amusement.</p>

<p>"Are you alone, my dears?" she finally
asked the little American girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Henry and I came all by ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
from the hotel. Poor mamma had such a bad
headache she could not come, but she did not
want us to be disappointed, so she got the
hotel porter to put us on the right 'bus, and he
told the conductor where to let us off, and all
we have got to do when we want to go back
is to ask the big policeman at the gate to put
us on the same 'bus again."</p>

<p>"Oh," gasped Edith in amazement, "aren't
you afraid?"</p>

<p>She could not imagine Adelaide and herself
crossing several miles of the busiest part of
London without Mrs. Stamford, the governess,
or a maid accompanying them.</p>

<p>"Why, no, of course not," laughed Henry.
"It <i>is</i> rather hard to find the right 'bus, because
they have got so many names all over them,
but a policeman will always set you right; they
are right good fellows, your policemen; they
take a lot of trouble for one."</p>

<p>"Here they come," some one called out, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
cheering was heard, and the children jumped
up on their chairs.</p>

<p>First came a number of mounted policemen,
and then many carriages containing great
people, and members of the Royal Family.
Then the Royal Horse Guards, the finest
regiment of soldiers in the kingdom, whose
duty is always to escort the king. They did
make a fine showing in their white trousers
and red coats, their glittering breastplates and
helmets, swords clanking by their sides, and
sitting so straight on their black horses.</p>

<p>"They are fine," said Henry. "I wish
Billy could see them."</p>

<p>"Hush, here is the king," said Adelaide.</p>

<p>An open carriage passed swiftly. On the
high box sat the coachman and footman in the
royal liveries of a bright red, powdered wigs on
their heads, and on the lapel of the coachman's
coat was a huge rosette. At the back of the carriage
stood two footmen, also in the red livery.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>King Edward VII. was dressed in a field-marshal's
uniform, and kept his hand in
salute a greater part of the time.</p>

<p>Queen Alexandra was seated on his right,
and looked very sweet and pretty in a violet-coloured
dress and hat to match. She carried
in her hand a big bouquet of flowers. In a
moment they had passed, followed by more
soldiers. The children had waved their handkerchiefs,
and Henry and Carrie cheered with
the rest.</p>

<p>"We are going in your direction, and I will
see you safely on your 'bus, or perhaps you
had better take a cab," said Adelaide's mother,
to their new friends, as they walked to the big
gateway of the park.</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma'am," said the little American
children, "but we would rather go on top
of the 'bus; it is more fun, and we can see
more."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," the young Americans shouted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
as they climbed on their 'bus. "You must
come and see us when you come to New
York," called out Carrie, as with smiles and
waving hands the clumsy 'bus rolled them
away.</p>

<p>"What would you like to show Edith to-day?"
asked Mrs. Stamford of her little daughter,
as they sat at the breakfast-table the next
morning. "You will have a holiday from
your lessons while Edith is here, so Miss
Winton will go with you to-day."</p>

<p>"Of course she must see Westminster
Abbey, and the Tower of London, and Madame
Tussaud's, and the Zoo," said Adelaide,
in one breath.</p>

<p>"Not all in one day," laughed her mother.
"Suppose you go to the Abbey this morning
and drive with me this afternoon to Kensington
Palace. Then see the Tower to-morrow."</p>

<p>The girls were soon ready. "Let us walk,
Miss Winton," said Adelaide, as they crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the gardens into the busy street. "There is
so much we can show Edith on the way to
the Abbey. See, Edith, there is Buckingham
Palace, where the king lives when he is in
London."</p>

<p>It did not look as handsome as one imagines
a palace ought to look; it seemed rather dark
and gloomy, though it was a big building.</p>

<p>"You can tell that the king is there because
the royal standard is flying over the roof,"
explained Adelaide. "That is the Royal
Family's own flag. It is made of the three
coat-of-arms of the three kingdoms which
compose Great Britain,&mdash;the three golden
lions of England, the one rampant red lion
of Scotland, and the gold harp of Ireland. It
is different, you will see, from the ordinary
flag of England, called the 'Union Jack,'
and more elaborate and beautiful," said Miss
Winton. "The design of the 'Union Jack'
is made of the three crosses of the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
ancient patron saints of Great Britain,&mdash;St.
George of England, St. Andrew of Scotland,
and St. Patrick of Ireland."</p>

<p>They crossed St. James's Park, which is in
front of the palace, and a few minutes' walk
brought them to the beautiful church of Westminster
Abbey, which is the pride of every
Englishman.</p>

<p>Here, in front of the great altar, the English
kings and queens have been crowned, and
many of them lie buried in the chapels which
surround the choir.</p>

<p>Edith saw the coronation chair, which is
very old, and on which the sovereigns sit when
the crown is placed on their heads by the
Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p>Many monuments of good and great people,
as well as of kings and queens, fill the Abbey
to overflowing; for Englishmen consider it a
great honour to be buried under the stone
floor of the Abbey.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>But perhaps the most interesting part is
what is called the "Poets' Corner," where
most of the great English poets are either
buried, or have monuments erected to their
memory.</p>

<p>Our little American cousins will see there a
marble bust of their poet Longfellow, erected
by admirers of his in England.</p>

<p>"Do you see that stone in the floor with
the flowers on it?" said Miss Winton; "that
is the grave of the great author, Charles
Dickens, who wrote the touching story I
read to you, Adelaide, of 'Little Nell' and
her grandfather, called 'The Old Curiosity
Shop.'</p>

<p>"'The Old Curiosity Shop' itself is still to
be seen, which is the same house, it is claimed,
that Dickens took for the imaginary home of
'Little Nell,' and where she took such good
care of her grandfather."</p>

<p>As they left the Abbey, Miss Winton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
pointed out to Edith the great Houses of
Parliament, where the laws of the kingdom
are made.</p>

<p>"Let us stop, Miss Winton, and have a
glass of milk from the cows as we go through
the park," said Adelaide, as they walked
on.</p>

<p>"Do they have cows in London?" asked
Edith.</p>

<p>"Well, it does not seem likely, does it,"
smiled Miss Winton, "but these cows have
very old rights to be in St. James's Park, not
so very far from the Royal Palace, which you
saw this morning. Many years ago, before
London became the biggest city in the world,
as it now is, with its millions of people, there
used to be a big 'Milk Fair' at this end of
the park. Here were brought many cows,
and their milk was sold to the good people of
London. Now all that remains of this 'Milk
Fair' are the two cows you see yonder, tethered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
under the trees eating grass as composedly
as if they were out on a country
farm.</p>

<p>"The cows do not know how nearly they
came to losing their comfortable quarters
lately; for a new street is being put through
to connect the park with Trafalgar Square, and
those in charge of the work decided the poor
cows were in the way and must go. This
nearly broke the hearts of the two old sisters,
who own the cows, and sell the milk. So
they petitioned King Edward that they and
their cows might remain undisturbed. The
king kindly gave them permission, only they
will have to move a few hundred yards away
from their present place so as not to interfere
with the new street."</p>

<p>Under a wooden shelter the children found
the two old ladies filling glasses with milk for
the boys and girls who are now about the only
patrons of the "Milk Fair." Perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
sweetmeats and cakes that are also to be
bought there attract them as well.</p>

<p>"Now, we must hurry home," said Miss
Winton, "or we shall be late for lunch."</p>

<p>After lunch Mrs. Stamford drove with the
little girls to Kensington Palace. This is
another palace belonging to the king. You
see royalty had plenty of homes scattered
around, so when they got tired of one they
could move into another.</p>

<p>This palace is principally of interest because it
was the first home of Queen Victoria. But what
the children like to see are the toys she played
with during her childhood in the old palace.</p>

<p>They are all kept in the queen's old nursery.
Edith and Adelaide looked at them with a
hushed reverence, though they were plain,
simple little things,&mdash;some dolls and dolls'
house furniture, not half so fine as the toys
they had themselves at home, for the queen
had been brought up very simply.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE TOWER OF LONDON</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Let's</span> go to the Tower on top of a 'bus,"
clamoured the little girls, and it did not take
long for them to scramble up on to the first
one that came along. "It is so nice and
wobbly," they declared, "and the people in
the streets seem so far below." If one gets
a seat just back of the driver, who is generally
a jovial good fellow, he will tell you a lot
about London, as he drives along, for these
drivers are a sociable class of men. It is wonderful
to see them guiding the big clumsy
'buses through the mass of people and vehicles
of all kinds&mdash;costers' carts, automobiles, big
lumbering wagons, and hansom cabs flitting
about like busy flies. As often as not you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
will see a wagon, with a big load of hay, nearly
blocking up the street, and next to it a stylish
carriage with footmen in livery. Oh, you
can see almost anything in the London streets.
But the picturesque old omnibuses are soon to
disappear, and automobile 'buses are to take
their places.</p>

<p>I must tell you what a coster is. Costers
are people who go to the great London market,
called Covent Garden, and buy cheap vegetables
and fruits and flowers, and sell them in the
poorer parts of the city. The coster men dress
in velveteen suits trimmed with rows and rows
of pearl buttons, which they call "pearlies."
They are very proud of these costumes. The
women wear bright, gaudily coloured dresses,
and very big hats, covered with feathers.
They hawk their wares about in barrows or
little carts, drawn by such a tiny donkey (a
"moke" as the costers call it), that you wonder
how he is able to pull a whole family of costers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
as well as a big load of vegetables, as they
often do.</p>

<p>"Edith, that is St. Paul's Cathedral just
ahead of us; you can see its big dome for
miles around, and now we are in the old part
of London," explained Miss Winton. "Just
beyond is Bunhill Fields, where Daniel Defoe
who wrote that immortal children's story&mdash;'Robinson
Crusoe'&mdash;is buried. A plain
shaft or obelisk rises above his grave, and
not so very long ago the children of England
were asked to give a penny each toward building
this monument to the memory of the
author of their favourite story-book. Many
children responded and enough money was
raised for the purpose. You will see that the
inscription on it tells the story."</p>

<p>The little girls were much impressed, and
Edith said she would tell Clarence and Eleanor
about it, as they had just been reading
about Robinson Crusoe and his desert island.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are not the 'Beefeaters' splendid?" said
Adelaide, as they passed through the old
gateway into the Tower of London. "There
is the one, Miss Winton, who talked with
mamma and me the last time we were here.
I believe he remembers me and is coming this
way. He had a tame raven which he showed
us. See, Edith, there are a number of ravens
flying about; they make their home among
the old buildings, and the keepers feed them."</p>

<p>"Good morning, miss," said the old man,
as he came up. "I am very pleased to see
you again," and he bowed politely to the
little girls.</p>

<p>He was indeed as fine as a picture. The
"Yeomen of the Guard" hold a very exclusive
and enviable position. They attend the
king on all grand occasions. Their dress is
in the same style as that worn in the time
of King Henry VIII.: all of bright red,
trimmed heavily with gold braid, a big white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
ruff around their necks, and a lovely black
velvet hat. They carry a halberd, or sort
of lance with a sharp blade at the end. This
is the dress for grand occasions. Their everyday
costume is in the same style, but is not
quite so fine.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;AFTER WATCHING OTHER ANTICS OUR LITTLE FRIENDS
BADE THE &#39;BEEFEATER&#39; AND HIS PET GOOD-BYE&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"How is the raven?" asked Adelaide.
"My cousin would so much like to see him."</p>

<p>"There he is now. Come here, 'Blackie,'"
and he whistled to the solemn bird that came
hopping over the grass.</p>

<p>"Does he not look wise, Edith? and he can
do all sorts of tricks."</p>

<p>The bird flew on to his master's cap, and
peered down over the rim of it at him, as
much as to say "bo-peep," and then leaned
over and took a bit of sugar out of the old
man's mouth. After watching other antics
our little friends bade the "Beefeater" and
his pet good-bye and continued their walk
around the Tower, which is really much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
than a single tower. It is a big group of
buildings, with a square tower in the middle,
a high wall around it all, and a deep moat
which was once filled with water. The
"Tower" is very, very old; it was used for
a prison, and whenever anybody did something
the king did not like, he was put on a
boat and rowed down to the Tower and
locked up in one of the dungeons, and often
many prisoners had their heads chopped off,
and some of these were high-born ladies, too!</p>

<p>"I am glad I did not live in those days,
when they could cut off people's heads,"
said Edith, who shuddered as she looked at
the block of wood on which a poor queen's
head was once cut off.</p>

<p>"Yes, the Tower is full of dark memories,"
said Miss Winton. "You know the sad story
of the two little boy princes who lived in this
gloomy Tower, and how they were supposed
to have been put to death by their cruel uncle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
who was King Richard III., and wanted them
out of his way.</p>

<p>"Long afterward, in repairing one of the
walls, the workmen found buried in a hole in
the wall the bones of two small children,
which were supposed to be those of the poor
little princes, which had been hidden there
after their untimely death. Many dreadful
things were done in those old days which
could never happen now."</p>

<p>"Now let us see something bright," said
Miss Winton, "and leave these gloomy things
behind."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean; now is the time
for the 'Crown Jewels,'" cried Adelaide.</p>

<p>Our two little friends quickly ran up the
winding stone stairs of a small round tower
where the Crown Jewels are always kept
when the king and queen are not wearing
them.</p>

<p>Edith was dazzled by the glittering things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
which filled a large glass case in the centre of
the room.</p>

<p>There were crowns covered with all kinds
of precious stones, and sceptres, and other old
and valuable relics, all gold and jewels. But
no one is allowed to linger long in here, and
before the children had half time enough to
see all, they found themselves again in the
yard.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Carrie and Henry White
thought of the jewels when they came to the
tower," said Edith.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt but that they greatly
enjoyed seeing it all. The American children
are as fond of a visit to the Tower as the
English children," and Miss Winton smiled as
they drove through the dark, narrow streets of
old London, to their home in the newer and
brighter part of the town.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>MADAME TUSSAUD'S AND THE ZOO</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mamma</span> is going herself with us to-day,"
said Adelaide, as the two cousins went down-stairs
to the breakfast-room, with their arms
around each other. Walking down a stairway
in this manner is not easy, for one must keep
step, but after much laughter they got there,
and sat down to their toast and eggs and jam
with a good appetite.</p>

<p>"What are we going to see to-day, aunty?"
asked Edith, holding Fluff while Adelaide put
down his saucer of milk, for his Highness had
a way of trying to lift it down himself with his
paws, to the detriment of the rug.</p>

<p>"Suppose we make a day of it, that is, if
you young people are not tired," and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Stamford smiled as the little girls broke in with
a chorus of "No, indeeds." "Then we will
go to Madame Tussaud's this morning, and
from there to the 'Zoo,' and have lunch in the
gardens."</p>

<p>"Oh, lovely! lovely!" said the little girls,
and, giving Mrs. Stamford a kiss, they ran up-stairs
to get ready so that no time should be
lost in getting off.</p>

<p>Perhaps you don't know that Madame
Tussaud's and the "Zoo" are the two attractions
that English children most enjoy seeing.</p>

<p>Madame Tussaud's Wax-works are famous
the world over, and though there are other
wax-works in various cities, such as the Eden
Musée in New York, which have been modelled
on this one in London, Madame Tussaud's
will always linger in one's mind as the
greatest show of its kind.</p>

<p>"They look like real people," said Edith,
as they walked through the big room with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
hundreds of wax figures in all kinds of costumes.
There were kings and queens and
great people of a bygone time in rich court
costumes, as well as great and notorious people
of the present day. Though Adelaide had
visited it many times, she was just as much
interested as Edith, who was seeing it for the
first time. But when they came to the
"Chamber of Horrors" one look was enough
for poor Edith, and Mrs. Stamford had to take
her out, pale and trembling. Its realistic
horrors were too much for her, and her aunt
and cousin were quite worried, but in a minute
she had recovered and laughed at herself for
her fright.</p>

<p>After this Mrs. Stamford declared that they
must look at nothing more than the travelling
carriage of the great Napoleon. It was in
this carriage that the great general drove to the
Battle of Waterloo, where he met his defeat.
It was like a small house on wheels, and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Stamford pointed out how a desk was built in
one corner and how a small table could be let
down for the emperor to eat from. There was
a bookcase with his favourite books, and the
seats were so arranged that they could be used
for a bed. Of course it is much heavier and
bigger than a carriage of to-day, but what did
that matter with four horses to pull it?</p>

<p>The "Zoo" is the playground of London
children, and in the afternoons, and on Saturday
half-holidays, hundreds of children go
there to see the animals and have tea under the
trees.</p>

<p>"We will have lunch first," said Mrs. Stamford,
as they left their carriage at the gate and
walked through the beautifully kept grounds.
"There is a table in a shady nook under the
trees where lunches and teas are served."</p>

<p>"Oh, what is that?" said Edith, and she
gave a scream as something cold and slippery
came creeping over her shoulder.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's nothing but the big elephant, who wants
you to give him a lump of sugar," said Adelaide,
laughing, and she turned her cousin
around and there was the great big elephant,
with a merry party of young people in the
"howdah" on his back, holding out his trunk,
just like a person begging.</p>

<p>He is a great pet with the children, and follows
them about like a dog, holding out his
trunk for the sugar and cakes with which they
are always feeding him.</p>

<p>"We will take a ride on him after lunch,"
said Adelaide, but when the time came it
was hard to persuade Edith to mount to the
seat on his back; it looked so high up and
wobbly. Finally the driver lifted her up in
his arms, and after all His Majesty moved off
so easily that Edith did not mind it at all, and
was sorry when the very short ride came to an
end.</p>

<p>"Oh, now for the lions and tigers; it's about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
their feeding-time; it is great fun to see them
eat," said Adelaide.</p>

<p>So she led her cousin into the house where
the big lions and long sleek tigers were stalking
about their cages. There was a general commotion
among the animals, for they knew that
it was dinner-time.</p>

<p>"There is the Black Panther. Isn't he a
beauty? I believe he is the only one in captivity,"
said Mrs. Stamford.</p>

<p>"He looks like a big black pussy, and I
would like to stroke his head," said Edith, as
she admired the black beauty.</p>

<p>"You would never want to do it again,"
laughed Adelaide.</p>

<p>Just then the keepers came in with heaped-up
baskets of raw meat. Such a noise, you never
heard. Edith caught hold of her aunt as if
she feared they would break through their iron
cages.</p>

<p>After this they visited the birds and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
monkeys, and lastly the house where the big
snakes lived. Oh, such snakes!</p>

<p>"They are fascinating, but creepy," Adelaide
said, as they watched the big boa-constrictors,
such as you read about in "The Swiss Family
Robinson"&mdash;yards and yards long, with wicked
eyes.</p>

<p>The general impression is that children never
get tired, but after these young people had
partaken of their evening meal in the schoolroom,
they were quite ready for bed.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and, after a little
later breakfast than usual, the two cousins,
looking fresh and pretty in their delicate frocks
and dainty flower-trimmed straw hats, each
carrying a prayer-book, were ready to accompany
Mrs. Stamford to church.</p>

<p>After church they strolled through the park,
as is the Sunday custom in London. "Church
Parade" it is called; where everybody meets
everybody else. They promenade up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
down the walks or sit in the "penny" chairs.
Friends gossip together, and make engagements
for the coming week.</p>

<p>It might be called an out-of-door reception.
Mrs. Stamford sat talking with some friends
while Adelaide and Edith watched the young
people, who were out in full force with their
parents or nurse-maids. Everybody was in
their prettiest clothes, and looked bright and
gay.</p>

<p>"Mamma will have visitors this afternoon,
so let us take a book into the gardens and
read," said Adelaide.</p>

<p>Every family who has a house in one of
these garden squares pays something toward
keeping up the garden, which is kept locked, and
only those who live in the square have keys
and can enter. There are seats and shady walks
and a grass plot for tennis and croquet; so it
is quite like having your own garden.</p>

<p>This was Edith's last day in London. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Howard was coming the next day, and Edith
was to return with her.</p>

<p>"You must come again; you have only
seen a little bit of London," said Mrs. Stamford.
"There is much more to show you
yet."</p>

<p>"Remember you are coming up for Lord
Mayor's day," were Adelaide's last words, and
with kisses Edith parted from her aunt and
cousin with reluctance.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HENLEY WEEK</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Did</span> you ever see anything so lovely? It
looks like a garden full of flowers of all
colours," exclaimed Edith, enthusiastically, as
she and Adelaide leaned over the railing of
Colonel Howard's house-boat, and looked up
and down the river.</p>

<p>I am sure every one would agree with her,
if they could be at the picturesque little village
of Henley-on-Thames during "the week," as
it is known. That is when the boat-races are
held there. It is the great open-air society
event for the younger people of England, a
great water <i>fête</i> or picnic. The nicest way to
enjoy the boat-races is to have a house-boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and live on it during the week, then one is on
the spot all the time.</p>

<p>A house-boat is really a small house that is
built on a flat boat, so that it can be towed
from place to place at its owner's pleasure.
There is a big room with perhaps two or more
small bedrooms. At the back is a tiny kitchen
and a larder or pantry.</p>

<p>"It's just like dolls keeping house; isn't it
lovely, mamma?" declared Edith.</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Mrs. Howard, thoughtfully,
as she looked in at the tiny larder. "It
is all very well for Henley, but I believe I do
prefer the manor."</p>

<p>Colonel Howard's house-boat was very
pretty and attractive. "The jolliest on the
river," Tom declared, and as Tom was an
important person on this occasion, his good
opinion was valued by his family.</p>

<p>Over the roof, which was used for a general
open-air sitting-room, was a brilliant red and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
white awning, and around the edge of the roof
or deck was a border of a solid mass of flowers,
splendid red geraniums and big white daisies,
while hanging down from these was a fringe of
green vines, all of which looked very pretty
with the brass railings around the deck, and
the bright woodwork of the boat itself, which
was painted white with green Venetian blinds
at the windows.</p>

<p>The deck was covered over with rugs, and
there were plenty of wicker lounging chairs
and cushions. Meals were served sometimes
on deck; sometimes in the big room below.</p>

<p>All the house-boats here were decorated in
some such way, and made a pretty picture, tied
up to the shore on one side of the river&mdash;a
long line of them. Their occupants entertained
their friends on board, and there was much
visiting done from one to another.</p>

<p>The course of one mile, along which the
races are rowed, is "staked off" by "booms"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
or logs tied together. On either side of this
course lay thousands of small boats as tightly
packed together as could be, for naturally
every one wanted to get as near the racing boats
as possible.</p>

<p>The ladies were all dressed in the loveliest of
dresses of all colours,&mdash;pale pinks, blues, and
lavenders, as well as white, with sunshades to
match. If it happens to be showery weather,
dear me! Many a pretty hat and dress is
spoilt. But this was a "dry" Henley, with
brilliant sunshine, so Edith was right when she
said the river looked like a garden of flowers.</p>

<p>The men looked very cool and comfortable
in their white flannel suits and straw hats.</p>

<p>Along both river banks were big tents, which
were used as club-houses by the various boat
clubs who were rowing in the races, while
thousands of spectators lined either side of the
river. English people take a great interest in
all kinds of sports, but they are specially fond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of boating, and they cheer the winning crews
at Henley with the greatest enthusiasm.</p>

<p>This afternoon the race in which Tom was
to row was coming off, and the Howard family
was in a great flutter of excitement. The crew
of Tom's boat were to take dinner afterward
on their house-boat, and if they should prove the
winners they would have an especially jolly feast.</p>

<p>Friends of the Howards from Oxford had
the house-boat next to theirs&mdash;their eldest
son was in one of the competing boats for the
"Ladies' Plate," and their two little boys,
the nine-year-old twins, Edgar and Will, held
great discussions with Edith and Adelaide over
the merits of the two rival boat crews.</p>

<p>The little girls' loyalty to Eton never wavered,
while the "Twins," as they were always called,
had a great contempt for any boat crew that did
not have their brother George in it.</p>

<p>The "Twins" were particularly arrogant
this afternoon, for the rumour had gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
ground that George's boat would prove the
best. However, the cry, "They have started,"
put an end to all talk.</p>

<p>It was one of the favourite races of the
week, and everybody was wild. On they
came, the young fellows straining, and the oars
glittering as they flew in and out of the water.
At first Eton was left behind, but they drew
up little by little on their rivals. Side by side
the rival crews kept, nearly up to goal, when
with a supreme effort Eton gave a spurt forward,
and won by half a boat's length. Such
cheers as went up! The Etonians were the
heroes for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>You may imagine the joy of Tom's family,
who were prouder of him than ever, and in
the eyes of the little girls he had grown several
inches taller. Don't you think it was very
good of the girls when they went over afterward
to take tea with the "Twins" that they
did not crow over them a bit?</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>SUMMER HOLIDAYS</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was the midsummer holidays. "No
more lessons," said Edith, as she danced
around the schoolroom. Soon, however, she
rushed up to Miss Green. "But I will miss
<i>you</i>, dear Miss Green. I wish you were going
with us," and the warm-hearted little girl
threw her arms around her governess.</p>

<p>Miss Green was also to take a holiday, and
visit her old home in the fine old town of
Canterbury, which is one of the most historic
places in England, best known for its splendid
cathedral, one of the grandest of the many
cathedrals of England.</p>

<p>Edith herself was going to spend a part of
the summer holidays in Warwickshire, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of the prettiest parts of England,&mdash;a lovely
rolling country of fields, farms, thatch-roofed
cottages, and great country houses.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 415px;">
<img src="images/i123.jpg" width="415" height="600" alt="church in background, family on path" />
<span class="caption">&quot;SHE WALKED DOWN THE PATH BY THE RIVER AVON&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>While there they were to visit Stratford-on-Avon,
the home of the great poet Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Edith caught the first glimpse of the old
church with a tall steeple, where the great
poet is buried, as she walked down the path
by the river Avon. There were visitors in
the church, as there always are, for there is no
spot in the world more visited than this.</p>

<p>People come to this church from all over
the world, and the American cousins think as
much of it as the English themselves. Edith
stood looking at the worn stone in the floor
before the altar. It was difficult to realize that
under this lay the ashes of the great Shakespeare.</p>

<p>They were alone in the church now; the
other visitors had gone, and Colonel and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Howard were resting in a pew, when Edith's
childish voice broke the silence of the old
church, as she slowly spelled out the strange
inscription on the stone.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Good frend for Jesus sake forbeare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To digg the dust encloased heare:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Blese be y<sup>e</sup> man y<sup>t</sup> spares thes stones,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And curst be he y<sup>t</sup> moves my bones."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"How funny some of the words are, papa,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the old way of spelling, as it
was in Shakespeare's time," answered Colonel
Howard.</p>

<p>They then walked through the neat little
market-town to Shakespeare's house. It had
been repaired many times, but always to look
as nearly like the original as possible.</p>

<p>Then they went to the famous old inn, the
Red Lion, for their dinner, where the American
author, Washington Irving, stayed, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
he wrote some of his charming stories about
English country life.</p>

<p>From Stratford, our friends went to Warwick,
which is most interesting, not only on
account of the picturesque old town with its
ancient houses, but because of its great castle
as well.</p>

<p>Edith's papa and mamma wanted her to see
this castle, which is one of the finest places in
England, and one of the few examples of an
old feudal castle which is still occupied and
kept as it was hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p>"Is not this a lovely old room, mamma?"
said Edith, as they sat at breakfast in the
coffee-room, or dining-room, of the quaint
inn at Warwick at which they were staying.
It <i>was</i> a pretty room, with walls of dark oak
panels. Around the room were hung many
plates and dishes of fine and rare old English
china. A big, high sideboard stood at one
end, on which were many pieces of antique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
silverware, also some good pewter mugs and
pitchers, which are now very valuable, and
some quaint old "Toby" jugs, which are in
the shape of a fat old gentleman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Howard poured out tea; and the sun
sparkled on the dainty silver and pretty china
of the well-set table.</p>

<p>Edith enjoyed the eggs with crisp slices of
bacon, and buttered toast, while the neat maid
cut for Colonel Howard slices of cold ham
from one of the huge joints of cold meat which
stood on the sideboard.</p>

<p>Edith admired very much a glass case of
stuffed birds just opposite her, such as one
will find in almost every country inn in England.
Over the door was another favourite
decoration, a model of an enormous trout.</p>

<p>"I think I will let papa take you over the
castle, while I rest here and write some letters,"
said Mrs. Howard.</p>

<p>So Edith and her papa walked through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
great gateway into Warwick Castle, and were
taken, with some other visitors, through many
of the fine old rooms, filled with magnificent
furniture, and pictures, and armour, and all
kinds of valuable and ancient things. They
saw the great cedars of Lebanon, which were
brought from the Holy Land, and planted
in the garden about 800 or 900 years ago.
That's a long time, isn't it?</p>

<p>The beautiful, rare, white peacocks were
also to be seen strutting about the courtyard,
spreading their great white tails to be admired.</p>

<p>Edith had much to tell her mamma while
they were eating lunch. Colonel Howard
also told his little daughter of other beautiful
houses he had visited, among them Haddon
Hall and Welbeck Abbey, which has a number
of the rooms built under ground. The
owners of most of these great houses in England
allow visitors to go through the principal
apartments on certain days in the week.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Edith's papa and mamma had spent the
preceding summer on the "Norfolk Broads."
The "Broads" are really lakes or rivers,
nearly all connected, so they had taken a sailboat
and sailed from one to another, living
meanwhile on their boat. This is a most
enjoyable way of spending some weeks, and
they had promised to go again some time and
take Edith.</p>

<p>Near the "Broads" is a spot of interest to
little American cousins,&mdash;the town of Boston
which gave its name to the American city.
There is a great contrast between the great
bustling city of Boston and this little old English
town. There is a tower there that is
called the "Boston Stump," why, one cannot
imagine, for it is a very nice church tower, and
does not look at all like a stump, though it
stands high up above the surrounding flat
country like a mariner's beacon.</p>

<p>Our party visited Oxford as well, stopping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
just long enough for Edith to see the gray,
time-stained walls of the many colleges which
go to make up the great university of Oxford.</p>

<p>"This is where Tom is coming when he
finishes at Eton," said Colonel Howard, as
he pointed out to Edith his old college building
set about with a beautiful green lawn.</p>

<p>From here they returned to Oldham Manor,
but in August Edith went with her parents
to Cowes, on the Isle of Wight, where the
yacht races take place. Here are to be seen
hundreds of sailboats, and big steam yachts as
well.</p>

<p>Little girls do not often go to Cowes, for
yachting there is an amusement for "grown
ups." But Edith's parents wanted her to
enjoy her holidays with them as much as possible,
so she usually went, too. Her papa
told her so much about the yachts, that she
grew very wise and nautical, and they used to
nickname her the "Little Sailor."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LORD MAYOR'S SHOW</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the great events in the life of an English
child is to be able to go to London to the
"Lord Mayor's Show," which takes place
every year on the 9th of November. Thousands
of families from all over the country
come into London for that day, and bring the
young folks.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the great day, the
Howard and Stamford families had taken up
their position at two of the big windows of a
hotel, from which a good view of the parade
could be had. Eleanor and Clarence had
come up with the Howards, so you can fancy
what a merry party it was.</p>

<p>All the children but Edith had seen it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
before, but they were just as eager as if it were
a brand-new sight. As for Edith, she kept her
little nose glued to the window-pane, and
hardly winked her eyes for fear she might miss
something.</p>

<p>The "Lord Mayor's Show," like most customs
in England, is of very ancient origin. It
has always been considered a great honour to
be Lord Mayor of London, and live in the
Mansion House, as his home is called.</p>

<p>All children remember the story of Dick
Whittington and his cat, and how he heard
the bells of London, which said to him that he
would become Lord Mayor of London; and
I believe it is a true story, too, not about the
bells really talking to him, perhaps, but about
the little country boy who struggled on, and
<i>did</i> become the great Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor's rule only extends over
what is called the "City," which is now only
a small part of big London. Long ago, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the office was first created, what is now the
"City" was all there was of London. It was
enclosed at that time by walls.</p>

<p>Well, times have changed! London has
spread miles away on every side from the
"City," but the Lord Mayor of London
still holds almost an absolute sway over his
part of London. Many of the old laws still
exist; such as the king cannot go into the
"City" without the permission of the Lord
Mayor, who must meet him at the city boundary,
and present a sword which the king
touches, and then he can pass in. Of course
this is only a form now, but it is still a picturesque
ceremony which usually takes place
at Temple Bar on the Strand. Every year a
new Lord Mayor is chosen, and the "Show,"
which is a procession that passes through the
principal streets, is to celebrate his incoming.</p>

<p>Our little folks were becoming impatient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
though it was amusing enough to watch the
vast crowd moved hither and thither by the
good-natured policemen.</p>

<p>Companies of strolling minstrels amused
the waiting people, singing songs and cracking
jokes, while the vendors of the funny, coloured
programmes did a large business.</p>

<p>"I do believe they are coming at last."
These words of Adelaide's brought every
head as far out of the windows as possible.
Yes, there were the gorgeous coaches of the
Aldermen, but nothing to compare to the one
which followed,&mdash;the great, gilded coach of
the Lord Mayor himself, with the sword
of state sticking out of the window, because
it is too big for the carriage. You never
have seen, nor will ever see, anything more
splendid than the coachman to the Lord
Mayor. We have to talk about him first
because he is seen first. He is a tremendous
big fellow in red plush knee-breeches, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
coat all gold braid and lace. White silk stockings
cover his portly calves, and his shoes
sparkle with big buckles; a three-cornered hat
sits pompously on his big powdered wig, and
there is a bouquet in his coat, beside which a
cabbage would look small. Standing behind
the carriage are two footmen, only a trifle less
magnificent.</p>

<p>The coachman so catches the young people's
eyes they scarcely see the Lord Mayor inside
the gold coach, but he too is grand in his fine
robe of velvet and fur, and a magnificent
golden chain about his neck.</p>

<p>Then come the various Guilds or Societies
of the City of London. The Guild of Clockmakers,
and the Guild of Goldsmiths, the
Guild of Tanners, and many others. Then
come soldiers and bands of music, and floats
or wagons on which are symbolic designs and
tableaux.</p>

<p>The people cheer, and our little folks clap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
their hands, and think nothing in the world
could be so grand.</p>

<p>As Adelaide's mother once said to Edith,
"You have only yet seen a very small bit of
London." There is, indeed, much more to be
seen in this great old city, and in England, for
even if it is a very small country it holds a
great deal.</p>

<p>But we must for the present bid our little
English cousins "good-bye" and give some
other little cousin a chance.</p>
